# Traffic Control
## A Senior Project by Joel Fischer and Brandon See


### Premise:
+ Create a graphical simulation in Java
+ The simulation consists of cars travelling along a highway
+ Each car's acceleration and turning is controlled by a central intelligence
+ Each car has a fixed (achievable) arrival time
+ The AI system must maneuver the cars between lanes such that each car reaches the destination by the arrival time

### Why:
+ We became frustrated by the lack of vision shown even in systems such as Google's autonomous vehicle system, why not go further and have a central intelligence run every car?
+ We wanted to do something that would stretch our skills as programmers. This did so; maybe a bit too far for our skills at the time.

### How to run:
+ Load it up in Eclipse
+ Run the program, locate the roadCoords.road file that is within the Repo, open it.
+ Cars in black are not currently changing lanes, cars in blue, are.
+ The vertical lines denote mile markers.

### Known Issues:
+ Probably too many to list here. This project became insanely complex for the time we had to work on it.
+ We chose poorly for our drawing code, using SWT and AWT was not the best choice.
+ The AI systems are nascent.

As a learning experience this project was fantastic, the code we were writing at the end of the project was far superior to the beginning, but the code itself is pretty ugly.
